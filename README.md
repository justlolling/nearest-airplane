# nearest-airplane
My solution to a challenge to find the nearest plane. I have used an implementation of OpenSky's Python API
>> which can be found here: https://github.com/openskynetwork/opensky-api
My program uses Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the distance based on the latitude & longitude so is not completely accurate but gives a good idea.
